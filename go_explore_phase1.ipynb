        "### What is Go-Explore?\n",
        "\n",
        "Go-Explore is a novel exploration algorithm designed to solve \"hard-exploration\" problems in reinforcement learning. Traditional RL algorithms often struggle in sparse-reward environments due to two key failure modes:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Detachment**: The agent forgets how to return to promising states after exploring further.\n",
        "2. **Derailment**: Small stochastic perturbations cause the agent to deviate from promising trajectories, making it difficult to reproduce successful behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Core Idea\n",
        "\n",
        "Go-Explore addresses these issues through a simple yet powerful principle: **\"Remember promising states and systematically return to them to explore further.\"**\n",
        "\n",
        "The algorithm maintains an **archive** of visited states (represented as abstract \"cells\") along with the trajectories needed to reach them. It then:\n",
        "1. Selects a promising cell from the archive\n",
        "2. **Returns** to that cell deterministically (solving detachment)\n",
        "3. **Explores** from that cell with random actions\n",
        "4. Adds any newly discovered cells to the archive\n",
        "\n",
        "### Two-Phase Approach\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Phase 1 (\"Explore Until Solved\")**: Use the archive-based exploration to find a solution in a deterministic environment\n",
        "- **Phase 2 (\"Robustification\")**: Train a robust policy via imitation learning (not implemented here)\n",
        "\n",
        "### This Notebook\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook implements **Phase 1 only**, demonstrating the core exploration mechanism of Go-Explore in the simple FrozenLake environment. We show how the \"return-then-explore\" strategy systematically discovers all reachable states, solving the exploration problem that stymies standard random exploration.\n"

        "### Key Components\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3.1 State Abstraction: Cells\n",
        "\n",
        "Go-Explore groups similar states into abstract **cells**. In our FrozenLake implementation, each grid position naturally corresponds to a unique cell (the agent's position). This abstraction:\n",
        "- Reduces memory requirements\n",
        "- Makes the archive more manageable\n",
        "- Focuses exploration on meaningfully different states\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3.2 The Archive\n",
        "\n",
        "The archive is the heart of Go-Explore. It stores:\n",
        "- **Cell representation**: An abstract representation of the state\n",
        "- **Trajectory**: The sequence of actions needed to reach that cell from the start\n",
        "- **Reward**: The cumulative reward obtained along that trajectory\n",
        "\n",
        "The archive grows as we discover new cells during exploration.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3.3 Return-Then-Explore\n",
        "\n",
        "The algorithm follows a simple loop:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Select**: Choose a cell from the archive (randomly or by heuristic)\n",
        "2. **Return**: Deterministically execute the stored trajectory to reach that cell\n",
        "3. **Explore**: Take K random exploratory actions from that cell\n",
        "4. **Update**: Add any newly discovered cells to the archive\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach solves both failure modes:\n",
        "- **Detachment**: We never \"forget\" how to return to promising states—the trajectory is stored\n",
        "- **Derailment**: We return deterministically (no stochasticity), ensuring we reliably reach the chosen cell\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3.4 Why This Works\n",
        "\n",
        "Traditional random exploration struggles because:\n",
        "- Randomly revisiting a specific state is exponentially unlikely in large state spaces\n",
        "- Once we've moved away from a promising state, we rarely return to it\n",
        "\n",
        "Go-Explore systematically revisits all discovered states, ensuring comprehensive exploration without relying on rare random events.\n",

        "## 6. Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "### What We Demonstrated\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook implemented **Phase 1 of Go-Explore**, the \"Explore Until Solved\" phase, demonstrating the algorithm's core innovation in solving hard-exploration problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Takeaways\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Archive-Based Exploration**: By maintaining an archive of visited states and their trajectories, Go-Explore can systematically explore the state space without forgetting how to return to promising regions.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Solving Detachment**: The algorithm stores exact trajectories to reach each cell, ensuring we never \"forget\" how to return to any discovered state. This is crucial for building on past progress.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Solving Derailment** (in deterministic settings): By returning deterministically to stored cells, we avoid the stochasticity that causes traditional algorithms to fail in reproducing successful behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Systematic vs Random**: Our comparison shows that Go-Explore's systematic \"return-then-explore\" approach discovers more states and achieves better rewards than pure random exploration, which suffers from detachment.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Phase 1 vs Phase 2\n",
        "\n",
        "**What we implemented (Phase 1):**\n",
        "- Archive maintenance\n",
        "- Deterministic return via trajectory replay\n",
        "- Random exploration from archived cells\n",
        "- Works in deterministic environments\n",
        "\n",
        "**What we omitted (Phase 2 - Robustification):**\n",
        "- Training a robust policy via imitation learning\n",
        "- Using the Backward Algorithm or PPO to learn from discovered trajectories\n",
        "- Handling stochastic environments\n",
        "- Deploying the policy in the real world\n",
        "\n",
        "Phase 2 would take the solution trajectory found by Phase 1 and train a neural network policy to robustly execute it even in stochastic environments. This could be implemented using behavioral cloning or policy optimization algorithms like PPO.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Limitations of This Implementation\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Deterministic Requirement**: Phase 1 only works in deterministic environments. In stochastic settings, trajectory replay would not reliably return to the same cell.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Simple State Abstraction**: We used the raw grid position as our cell. More complex environments (e.g., images) would need sophisticated abstraction functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Random Cell Selection**: We randomly select cells from the archive. The paper suggests more sophisticated heuristics (e.g., prioritizing high-reward or less-visited cells).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **No Robustification**: The trajectories found are brittle—any environmental stochasticity would break them. Phase 2 addresses this.\n",
