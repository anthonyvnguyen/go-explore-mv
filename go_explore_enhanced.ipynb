    "## Introduction to Enhancements\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements three key enhancements to the standard Go-Explore Phase 1 algorithm to improve exploration efficiency:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dyna Component (Model-Based Planning)**: \n",
    "   Instead of relying solely on real interactions, we learn a transition model ($s, a \\to s', r$) and use it to perform short \"imagined\" rollouts. This allows us to estimate the \"novelty\" of exploring from a cell without actually visiting it, saving environment steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Prioritized Sweeping (Value-Driven Scheduling)**:\n",
    "   We maintain TD-values ($V(s)$) for discovered cells. When we find a significant change in value (e.g., discovering a path to the goal or a high-reward area), we propagate this value backwards to predecessor states using a priority queue. This helps prioritize cells that lead to high-value regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Learned Cell Selector (REINFORCE Policy)**:\n",
    "   Standard Go-Explore uses a heuristic weight $W \\propto 1/\\sqrt{N_{visits}}$. We replace/augment this with a learned policy network. The network takes cell features (depth, visit count, Dyna novelty, priority) and outputs a selection probability. It is trained using REINFORCE to maximize the discovery of new cells and reward."

    "### Strengths and Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strengths of Enhanced Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Improved Sample Efficiency**: The enhanced algorithm typically solves the problem in fewer iterations by:\n",
    "   - Using Dyna planning to estimate exploration potential before committing to real steps\n",
    "   - Prioritizing cells with high value-change potential via Prioritized Sweeping\n",
    "   - Learning adaptive cell selection that improves over time\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Better Exploration Guidance**: \n",
    "   - Dyna novelty estimates help bias initial actions toward unexplored transitions\n",
    "   - Value propagation identifies promising paths to high-reward regions\n",
    "   - Learned selector adapts to the specific exploration patterns of the environment\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interpretability**: Each component provides interpretable signals:\n",
    "   - Dyna model shows which states have been visited most\n",
    "   - Value function visualizes the learned reward landscape\n",
    "   - Selector policy can be analyzed to understand selection preferences\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Computational Overhead**: \n",
    "   - Dyna planning requires maintaining transition/reward models and running imagined rollouts\n",
    "   - Prioritized Sweeping adds value updates and priority queue management\n",
    "   - Learned selector requires policy network forward/backward passes\n",
    "   - For very simple environments, this overhead may not be justified\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**:\n",
    "   - Dyna rollout depth and count affect novelty estimates\n",
    "   - Sweeping threshold and update budget control value propagation\n",
    "   - Selector learning rate and mixture ratio affect exploration-exploitation balance\n",
    "   - Requires tuning for optimal performance\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Memory Requirements**:\n",
    "   - Transition model: O(S × A × S) for state-action-next_state counts\n",
    "   - Value table: O(S) for V-values\n",
    "   - Priority queue: O(S) in worst case\n",
    "   - For larger state spaces, this could become prohibitive\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Early Learning Phase**:\n",
    "   - Dyna model needs sufficient experience before providing useful novelty estimates\n",
    "   - Value function requires reward signals to propagate meaningful values\n",
    "   - Selector policy needs exploration history to learn effective selection patterns\n",
    "   - Initial performance may be similar to baseline until components \"warm up\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to Use Enhanced vs Original\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Enhanced when:**\n",
    "- Environment interactions are expensive (real robots, simulations)\n",
    "- State space is moderate (hundreds to thousands of states)\n",
    "- Exploration efficiency is critical\n",
    "- You have computational resources for model updates\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Original when:**\n",
    "- Environment is very simple or fast to simulate\n",
    "- State space is extremely large (millions+ states)\n",
    "- Computational resources are limited\n",
    "- You need a simple, interpretable baseline\n"

    "### Experimental Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "From the ablation study, we can observe:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Individual Component Effects**: Each component provides some benefit, but the combination yields the best results.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dyna Impact**: Dyna planning helps by providing novelty estimates, but alone it may not be sufficient if the model is inaccurate early on.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sweeping Impact**: Prioritized Sweeping helps focus on high-value regions, but without a good value signal (e.g., early in training), its benefit is limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Learned Selector Impact**: The learned selector adapts over time, but requires sufficient exploration history to learn effective patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Synergistic Effects**: The components work best together:\n",
    "   - Dyna provides novelty signals for the selector\n",
    "   - Sweeping provides priority signals for the selector\n",
    "   - The selector learns to combine these signals effectively\n",
    "   - Together, they create a more efficient exploration strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Directions\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential improvements for future work:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Adaptive Component Weighting**: Dynamically adjust the mixture ratio between learned and heuristic selection based on exploration progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Better Value Initialization**: Use optimistic initialization or intrinsic motivation to provide better value signals early in training.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hierarchical Planning**: Use Dyna planning at multiple time scales (short-term and long-term) for better exploration guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Transfer Learning**: Pre-train the selector policy on similar environments to bootstrap learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Scalability**: Extend to continuous or high-dimensional state spaces using function approximation for the models and value function.\n"

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This enhanced implementation successfully integrates three key enhancements to the Go-Explore algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dyna Component**: The `DynaModel` learns the environment dynamics and `dyna_planning` uses it to guide exploration by estimating novelty before committing to real environment steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Prioritized Sweeping**: `PrioritizedSweeping` maintains a value map and propagates rewards backwards to focus on promising paths, avoiding wasted effort in dead ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Learned Cell Selector**: The `CellSelectorPolicy` learns to pick cells that yield high returns (new discoveries) using REINFORCE, adapting beyond fixed heuristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Near-Miss Curriculum**: We identified states close to the goal to aid Phase 2 training for improved robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experimental Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Through comprehensive comparison with the original baseline and ablation studies, we demonstrated that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The enhanced algorithm solves the problem faster** than the original, requiring fewer iterations to reach the goal.\n",
    "- **All three components work synergistically** - the combination provides better performance than any individual component alone.\n",
    "- **The improvements are consistent** across multiple runs with proper random seed control.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Contributions\n",
    "\n",
    "These components work together to make exploration more efficient and targeted than simple random or count-based heuristics. The enhanced algorithm maintains the core Go-Explore principles (archive-based exploration, deterministic returns) while adding intelligent guidance through model-based planning, value-driven scheduling, and learned selection policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation provides a solid foundation for applying Go-Explore to more complex environments where sample efficiency is critical."
