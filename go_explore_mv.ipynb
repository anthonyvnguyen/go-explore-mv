        "## 1. Introduction and Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "### What is Go-Explore?\n",
        "\n",
        "Go-Explore is a novel exploration algorithm designed to solve \"hard-exploration\" problems in reinforcement learning. Traditional RL algorithms often struggle in sparse-reward environments due to two key failure modes:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Detachment**: The agent forgets how to return to promising states after exploring further.\n",
        "2. **Derailment**: Small stochastic perturbations cause the agent to deviate from promising trajectories, making it difficult to reproduce successful behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Core Idea\n",
        "\n",
        "Go-Explore addresses these issues through a simple yet powerful principle: **\"Remember promising states and systematically return to them to explore further.\"**\n",
        "\n",
        "The algorithm maintains an **archive** of visited states (represented as abstract \"cells\") along with the trajectories needed to reach them. It then:\n",
        "1. Selects a promising cell from the archive using **weighted selection** (prioritizes frontier cells)\n",
        "2. **Returns** to that cell deterministically (solving detachment)\n",
        "3. **Explores** from that cell with random actions\n",
        "4. Adds any newly discovered cells to the archive\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Innovation:** Our implementation uses weighted cell selection where rarely-explored cells have higher probability of being selected, ensuring systematic frontier expansion.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Two-Phase Approach\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Phase 1 (\"Explore Until Solved\")**: Use archive-based exploration to find a solution in a deterministic environment\n",
        "- **Phase 2 (\"Robustification\")**: Train a robust neural network policy using PPO and the Backward Algorithm\n",
        "\n",
        "### This Notebook\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook implements **both phases** of Go-Explore with key algorithmic features:\n",
        "- **Phase 1** demonstrates the core exploration mechanism with **weighted cell selection** for systematic frontier expansion\n",
        "- **Phase 2** trains a robust policy that converts the brittle Phase 1 trajectory into a generalizable neural network\n",
        "\n",
        "We use a **custom 16×16 FrozenLake map** with the goal positioned in the bottom-right quadrant (not the corner) and strategically placed holes to make pathfinding non-trivial. This demonstrates how Go-Explore solves hard-exploration problems that defeat conventional reinforcement learning algorithms.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Implementation Highlights:**\n",
        "- ✅ Weighted cell selection (prioritizes rarely-visited frontier cells)\n",
        "- ✅ Sticky random exploration (90% probability of repeating last action)\n",
        "- ✅ Behavior cloning warm-start before PPO training\n",
        "- ✅ Comprehensive visualization of selection patterns and archive statistics\n",
        "- ✅ PPO-based robustification with Backward Algorithm curriculum learning\n",
        "- ✅ Custom 10% slipperiness testing (validates generalization to manageable noise levels)\n"

        "### Key Components\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3.1 State Abstraction: Cells\n",
        "\n",
        "Go-Explore groups similar states into abstract **cells**. In our FrozenLake implementation, each grid position naturally corresponds to a unique cell (the agent's position). This abstraction:\n",
        "- Reduces memory requirements\n",
        "- Makes the archive more manageable\n",
        "- Focuses exploration on meaningfully different states\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3.2 The Archive\n",
        "\n",
        "The archive is the heart of Go-Explore. It stores:\n",
        "- **Cell representation**: An abstract representation of the state\n",
        "- **Trajectory**: The sequence of actions needed to reach that cell from the start\n",
        "- **Reward**: The cumulative reward obtained along that trajectory\n",
        "\n",
        "The archive grows as we discover new cells during exploration.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3.3 Return-Then-Explore\n",
        "\n",
        "The algorithm follows a simple loop:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Select**: Choose a cell from the archive using **weighted selection** (prioritizes rarely-visited cells)\n",
        "2. **Return**: Deterministically execute the stored trajectory to reach that cell\n",
        "3. **Explore**: Take K random exploratory actions from that cell\n",
        "4. **Update**: Add any newly discovered cells to the archive\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach solves both failure modes:\n",
        "- **Detachment**: We never \"forget\" how to return to promising states—the trajectory is stored\n",
        "- **Derailment**: We return deterministically (no stochasticity), ensuring we reliably reach the chosen cell\n",
        "\n",
        "**Weighted Selection (Key Innovation):** Our implementation uses the paper's weighted selection strategy where cell selection probability is inversely proportional to the number of times it has been chosen: `Weight(cell) ∝ 1 / (times_chosen + 0.1)^0.5`. This ensures systematic frontier expansion rather than random wandering.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3.4 Why This Works\n",
        "\n",
        "Traditional random exploration struggles because:\n",
        "- Randomly revisiting a specific state is exponentially unlikely in large state spaces\n",
        "- Once we've moved away from a promising state, we rarely return to it\n",
        "\n",
        "Go-Explore systematically revisits all discovered states, ensuring comprehensive exploration without relying on rare random events.\n",

        "We successfully implemented **Phase 1 of Go-Explore** (\"Explore Until Solved\"), demonstrating the algorithm's core innovation in solving hard-exploration problems through systematic archive-based exploration.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Takeaways from Phase 1\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Archive-Based Exploration**: By maintaining an archive of visited states and their trajectories, Go-Explore systematically explores the state space without forgetting how to return to promising regions.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Solving Detachment**: The algorithm stores exact trajectories to reach each cell, ensuring we never \"forget\" how to return to any discovered state. This is crucial for building on past progress.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Solving Derailment** (in deterministic settings): By returning deterministically to stored cells, we avoid the stochasticity that causes traditional algorithms to fail in reproducing successful behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Systematic vs Random**: Our comparison shows that Go-Explore's systematic \"return-then-explore\" approach discovers more states and achieves better rewards than pure random exploration.\n",

        "While Phase 1 successfully discovers a solution trajectory through systematic exploration, this trajectory is **brittle**: it only works in the deterministic environment and requires exact state-by-state replay. Any environmental stochasticity would break the solution.\n",

        "- **Imitation Learning**: Learn to reproduce the successful trajectories from the archive\n",
        "- **Policy Optimization**: Use PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) to refine the policy\n",
        "- **Backward Algorithm**: A curriculum learning strategy that trains the policy starting from near the goal, then progressively moves the training start point earlier in the trajectory\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Training a policy to solve the entire task from scratch is difficult due to:\n",
        "- **Sparse rewards**: Success is only achieved at the end\n",
        "- **Credit assignment**: Hard to determine which early actions led to success\n",
        "- **Exploration**: The policy must explore extensively to find the goal\n",
        "\n",
        "The **Backward Algorithm** solves this by:\n",
        "1. **Starting near the goal**: Initial training begins from states close to success (e.g., last 10% of the trajectory)\n",
        "2. **High initial success rate**: The policy quickly learns to reach the goal from nearby states\n",
        "3. **Progressive curriculum**: Once the policy achieves >90% success from the current starting point, we move the start earlier in the trajectory\n",
        "4. **Gradual difficulty increase**: This continues until the policy can solve the task from the initial state\n",
