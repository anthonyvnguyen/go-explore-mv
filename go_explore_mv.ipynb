        "### What is Go-Explore?\n",
        "\n",
        "Go-Explore is a novel exploration algorithm designed to solve \"hard-exploration\" problems in reinforcement learning. Traditional RL algorithms often struggle in sparse-reward environments due to two key failure modes:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Detachment**: The agent forgets how to return to promising states after exploring further.\n",
        "2. **Derailment**: Small stochastic perturbations cause the agent to deviate from promising trajectories, making it difficult to reproduce successful behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Core Idea\n",
        "\n",
        "Go-Explore addresses these issues through a simple yet powerful principle: **\"Remember promising states and systematically return to them to explore further.\"**\n",
        "\n",
        "The algorithm maintains an **archive** of visited states (represented as abstract \"cells\") along with the trajectories needed to reach them. It then:\n",
        "1. Selects a promising cell from the archive\n",
        "2. **Returns** to that cell deterministically (solving detachment)\n",
        "3. **Explores** from that cell with random actions\n",
        "4. Adds any newly discovered cells to the archive\n",
        "\n",
        "### Two-Phase Approach\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Phase 1 (\"Explore Until Solved\")**: Use the archive-based exploration to find a solution in a deterministic environment\n",
        "- **Phase 2 (\"Robustification\")**: Train a robust policy via imitation learning (not implemented here)\n",
        "\n",
        "### This Notebook\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook implements **Phase 1 only**, demonstrating the core exploration mechanism of Go-Explore in the simple FrozenLake environment. We show how the \"return-then-explore\" strategy systematically discovers all reachable states, solving the exploration problem that stymies standard random exploration.\n"

        "### Key Components\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3.1 State Abstraction: Cells\n",
        "\n",
        "Go-Explore groups similar states into abstract **cells**. In our FrozenLake implementation, each grid position naturally corresponds to a unique cell (the agent's position). This abstraction:\n",
        "- Reduces memory requirements\n",
        "- Makes the archive more manageable\n",
        "- Focuses exploration on meaningfully different states\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3.2 The Archive\n",
        "\n",
        "The archive is the heart of Go-Explore. It stores:\n",
        "- **Cell representation**: An abstract representation of the state\n",
        "- **Trajectory**: The sequence of actions needed to reach that cell from the start\n",
        "- **Reward**: The cumulative reward obtained along that trajectory\n",
        "\n",
        "The archive grows as we discover new cells during exploration.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3.3 Return-Then-Explore\n",
        "\n",
        "The algorithm follows a simple loop:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Select**: Choose a cell from the archive (randomly or by heuristic)\n",
        "2. **Return**: Deterministically execute the stored trajectory to reach that cell\n",
        "3. **Explore**: Take K random exploratory actions from that cell\n",
        "4. **Update**: Add any newly discovered cells to the archive\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach solves both failure modes:\n",
        "- **Detachment**: We never \"forget\" how to return to promising states—the trajectory is stored\n",
        "- **Derailment**: We return deterministically (no stochasticity), ensuring we reliably reach the chosen cell\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3.4 Why This Works\n",
        "\n",
        "Traditional random exploration struggles because:\n",
        "- Randomly revisiting a specific state is exponentially unlikely in large state spaces\n",
        "- Once we've moved away from a promising state, we rarely return to it\n",
        "\n",
        "Go-Explore systematically revisits all discovered states, ensuring comprehensive exploration without relying on rare random events.\n",

        "\n",
        "### What We Demonstrated\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook implemented **Phase 1 of Go-Explore**, the \"Explore Until Solved\" phase, demonstrating the algorithm's core innovation in solving hard-exploration problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Takeaways\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Archive-Based Exploration**: By maintaining an archive of visited states and their trajectories, Go-Explore can systematically explore the state space without forgetting how to return to promising regions.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Solving Detachment**: The algorithm stores exact trajectories to reach each cell, ensuring we never \"forget\" how to return to any discovered state. This is crucial for building on past progress.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Solving Derailment** (in deterministic settings): By returning deterministically to stored cells, we avoid the stochasticity that causes traditional algorithms to fail in reproducing successful behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Systematic vs Random**: Our comparison shows that Go-Explore's systematic \"return-then-explore\" approach discovers more states and achieves better rewards than pure random exploration, which suffers from detachment.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Phase 1 vs Phase 2\n",
        "\n",
        "**What we implemented (Phase 1):**\n",
        "- Archive maintenance\n",
        "- Deterministic return via trajectory replay\n",
        "- Random exploration from archived cells\n",
        "- Works in deterministic environments\n",
        "\n",
        "**What we omitted (Phase 2 - Robustification):**\n",
        "- Training a robust policy via imitation learning\n",
        "- Using the Backward Algorithm or PPO to learn from discovered trajectories\n",

        "- Deploying the policy in the real world\n",
        "\n",
        "Phase 2 would take the solution trajectory found by Phase 1 and train a neural network policy to robustly execute it even in stochastic environments. This could be implemented using behavioral cloning or policy optimization algorithms like PPO.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Limitations of This Implementation\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Deterministic Requirement**: Phase 1 only works in deterministic environments. In stochastic settings, trajectory replay would not reliably return to the same cell.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Simple State Abstraction**: We used the raw grid position as our cell. More complex environments (e.g., images) would need sophisticated abstraction functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Random Cell Selection**: We randomly select cells from the archive. The paper suggests more sophisticated heuristics (e.g., prioritizing high-reward or less-visited cells).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **No Robustification**: The trajectories found are brittle—any environmental stochasticity would break them. Phase 2 addresses this.\n",

        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "While Phase 1 successfully discovers a solution trajectory through systematic exploration, this trajectory is **brittle**: it only works in the deterministic environment and requires exact state-by-state replay. Any environmental stochasticity would break the solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Phase 2** addresses this limitation by training a **robust neural network policy** that can:\n",
        "1. Generalize across different starting conditions\n",
        "2. Handle environmental stochasticity\n",
        "3. Recover from small perturbations\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Go-Explore Phase 2 Approach\n",
        "\n",
        "According to the original paper (Ecoffet et al., 2019), Phase 2 uses:\n",
        "- **Imitation Learning**: Learn to reproduce the successful trajectories from the archive\n",
        "- **Policy Optimization**: Use PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) to refine the policy\n",
        "- **Backward Algorithm**: A curriculum learning strategy that trains the policy starting from near the goal, then progressively moves the training start point earlier in the trajectory\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why the Backward Algorithm?\n",
        "\n",
        "Training a policy to solve the entire task from scratch is difficult due to:\n",
        "- **Sparse rewards**: Success is only achieved at the end\n",
        "- **Credit assignment**: Hard to determine which early actions led to success\n",
        "- **Exploration**: The policy must explore extensively to find the goal\n",
        "\n",
        "The **Backward Algorithm** solves this by:\n",
        "1. **Starting near the goal**: Initial training begins from states close to success (e.g., last 10% of the trajectory)\n",
        "2. **High initial success rate**: The policy quickly learns to reach the goal from nearby states\n",
        "3. **Progressive curriculum**: Once the policy achieves >90% success from the current starting point, we move the start earlier in the trajectory\n",
        "4. **Gradual difficulty increase**: This continues until the policy can solve the task from the initial state\n",
        "\n",
        "This curriculum ensures the policy always has a clear learning signal and builds competence incrementally.\n",

        "\n",
        "### What We Accomplished\n",
        "\n",
        "This Phase 2 implementation successfully demonstrates the **robustification** phase of Go-Explore:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Converted brittle trajectories into robust policies**: The Phase 1 exploration discovered a solution trajectory, but it only worked through exact replay. Phase 2 trained a neural network policy that can solve the task independently.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Implemented the Backward Algorithm**: Rather than training from scratch, we used a curriculum learning approach that:\n",
        "   - Started training from near the goal (high success rate, clear learning signal)\n",
        "   - Progressively moved the starting point earlier in the trajectory\n",
        "   - Advanced to the next stage only when achieving >90% success\n",
        "   - Built competence incrementally from easy to hard\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Used PPO for policy optimization**: We implemented the core PPO algorithm with:\n",
        "   - Clipped objective (ε = 0.2) to prevent large policy updates\n",
        "   - Actor-Critic architecture with separate policy and value heads\n",
        "   - GAE (Generalized Advantage Estimation) for variance reduction\n",
        "   - Entropy bonus to encourage exploration\n",
        "\n",
        "### Connection to the Original Go-Explore Paper\n",
        "\n",
        "**What matches the paper:**\n",
        "- ✓ Two-phase approach (exploration → robustification)\n",
        "- ✓ Backward Algorithm curriculum learning\n",
        "- ✓ PPO as the policy optimization algorithm\n",
        "- ✓ Converting archive trajectories into robust policies\n",
        "- ✓ Progressive difficulty increase as the policy improves\n",
        "\n",
        "**What differs (due to environment simplicity):**\n",
        "- Original: CNN-based policy for Atari pixel inputs\n",
        "- Our version: MLP for discrete state inputs (one-hot encoded)\n",
        "- Original: Thousands of training episodes on complex environments\n",
        "- Our version: Fewer episodes on simpler FrozenLake environment\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key conceptual alignment:**\n",
        "> \"The second phase ('robustification') trains a policy via imitation learning to robustly navigate to the goal.\" — Ecoffet et al., 2019\n",
        "\n",
        "This is exactly what we implemented: using the Phase 1 solution as a training curriculum for a robust neural network policy.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why the Backward Algorithm Works\n",
        "\n",
        "The Backward Algorithm solves a fundamental problem in sparse-reward RL:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Problem without curriculum:**\n",
        "- Training from the start state requires discovering the entire solution through trial and error\n",
        "- Reward signal is only received at the goal (very sparse)\n",
        "- Early in training, the policy never reaches the goal, so it has no learning signal\n",
        "- This leads to extremely slow or failed learning\n",
        "\n",
        "**Solution with Backward Algorithm:**\n",
        "- Start training near the goal where success is easy to achieve\n",
        "- The policy quickly learns: \"from these states, do X to reach the goal\"\n",
        "- Once mastered, move the starting point earlier (slightly harder)\n",
        "- The policy builds on previous knowledge, learning incrementally\n",
        "- Continue until the full task can be solved from the initial state\n",
        "\n",
        "This is analogous to teaching someone a complex skill by starting with the final step, then adding earlier steps once each is mastered.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Potential Extensions\n",
        "\n",
        "This implementation could be extended in several ways to more closely match the full Go-Explore paper:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Stochastic environments**: Test robustness by enabling `is_slippery=True` in FrozenLake\n",
        "2. **Domain randomization**: Train on variations of the environment to improve generalization\n",
        "3. **Backward algorithm refinements**: Use more granular curriculum stages\n",
        "4. **Alternative robustification**: Try behavioral cloning or other imitation learning approaches\n",
        "5. **More complex environments**: Apply to environments with visual observations (e.g., Atari)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Final Thoughts\n",
        "\n",
        "Phase 2 transforms the exploration success of Phase 1 into a deployable policy. While Phase 1's deterministic trajectory replay is fragile, the trained neural network policy is:\n",
        "- **Generalizable**: Works from any starting state\n",
        "- **Robust**: Can handle minor perturbations (and with training, stochasticity)\n",
        "- **Efficient**: Makes decisions in real-time without needing archive lookup\n",
        "- **Transferable**: Can potentially adapt to related tasks\n",
        "\n",
        "This two-phase approach—systematic exploration followed by robust policy learning—is what makes Go-Explore so effective on hard-exploration problems.\n",
